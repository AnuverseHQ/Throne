# Throne

Throne is an omni-platform and language-agnostic backend library designed to provide APIs for dynamically interchanging data on various databases. Inspired by existing systems like Supabase and Firebase, Throne aims to extend beyond simple database interactions by supporting multiple database types (SQL, NoSQL) and providing flexibility for different programming languages.

Currently, this project is a work in progress with no code yet, and it draws inspiration from a Java Spring Boot library that dynamically constructs SQL queries based on API requests. The goal of Throne is to evolve this concept into a more robust and adaptable system that supports multiple platforms, databases, and languages.

## Features (Planned)
- Dynamic data interchange using API calls.
- Omni-platform support to work across different environments.
- Language-agnostic, allowing integration with multiple programming languages.
- Multi-database support, including relational and NoSQL databases.
- Future support for serverless architecture and real-time data handling via qRPC-Socket.

## Getting Started
This project is still in the early stages, and the codebase will be developed and released incrementally. Stay tuned for updates as we work on building the core functionality!

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from developers who are interested in shaping the future of Throne. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests as the project evolves.
